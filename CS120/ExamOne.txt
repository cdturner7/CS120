Topics:
*******

- Data Types        - Classes           - Output Manipulation
- File I/O          - Testing           - Operator Overloads
- Functions

Unary and Binary Operator Overflows:
************************************

Unary only needs one parameter, because it uses the object itself to compare to.
binary needs two parameters - one for the &lhs of the operator and one &rhs.



Streams:
********

object --> (cout , cin)

File I/O streams: need to make sure that the stream is in a good state so it can be used.
all have a buffer and reads to or out, and has a state.
if a stream breaks it will be in a fail state.


Random Questions:
*****************

What's the difference between vectors and arrays?
-   Arrays dont index out of bounds so they are dangerous,
    but they are essentially the same exact thing as vectors.
    DONT USE ARRAYS -> Use Vectors.
