 MY PROGRAM -
 
 This is a program to test the FIFA class. The class is designed 
 to hold information about a FIFA soccer player and then it 
 calculates the overall value of the player on a scale of 100. 
 It calculates this based on the goals, assists, and whether the 
 player starts or is a sub.
 
 Overloaded operaors were implemented to compare players 
 overall ratings.
 
 * These are also all stats in a given year. So typically a
 player doesnt score more than 20 goals or assists in a season 
 but the stats are made to support this.
 No player can actually hit a perfect score because no player 
 is perfect on the pitch. So the min is 65 and the max score 
 is set at 95, even though its on a scale of 0-100.
 
 Setters will only allow the expected input to be submitted as 
 parameter, but as for the setAssists and setGoals you can pass
 a double but it will be truncated. If you submit anything 
 negative then the player doesnt recieve any positive points 
 for goals or assists in their overall rating. (tested below)
