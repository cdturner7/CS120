 MY PROGRAM -
 
 The fourth part of my on going FIFA project transforms the 
 FIFA_player class into an abstract class, and four derived
 child classes FIFA_goalie, FIFA_midfielder, FIFA_defenseman 
 and FIFA_striker. These classes override and inherit specific 
 functions and fields defined in the parent class.
 
 The pure virtual method in the parent class FIFA_player is 
 calcOverall. This is a method that based upon the position
 or class the FIFA-player is in, the overall field is calculated
 differently. Example would be a striker's overall stat is affected
 by their shot accuracy percentage, goals and assists. But a goalie
 has overall calculated base upon goals conceded and saves.
 
 NOTE: goals are represented by total of the season. Similarly 
 assists are season long totals. However most if not all of the
 other individual child classes fields are per game (pg) statistics.
